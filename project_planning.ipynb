    "These two datasets were collected through a free MineCraft server set up by a CS group at UBC lead by Frank Wood. The research group records the actions the players take within the server, including gameplay, speech, and key presses (https://plaicraft.ai/faq/ethics). Dataset (a) is a record of specific information about the player such as name, age, and experience, while Dataset (b) has information on the time spent within the server."
